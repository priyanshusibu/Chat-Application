<h2>  Chatting Application </h2>
<h3> I have developed a chat application using Java socket programming and integrated Java Swing for the user interface. <br>
  This project facilitates real-time communication between users over a network. Users can exchange messages in a chat interface created with Java Swing components.<br>
  The application utilizes socket programming to establish connections between clients and the server, enabling seamless message transmission.<br>
  Overall, your project demonstrates practical implementation of networking concepts in Java and provides a user-friendly interface for communication.</h3>
